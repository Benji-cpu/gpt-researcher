Here are a few things they told us:\\n- Market timing is a challenge we need regulators, banks and governments to come on board. But with stablecoins we’ll find the next category-defining business.\\n- Traditional financial institutions (FIs) are experimenting. When they see clear ROI, they’ll start rolling out stablecoin rails to other countries – this will be a pivotal moment for market readiness.\\n- Stablecoins will reach a market cap of $250bn by the end of 2024, growing 2-3x the pace of the crypto market overall.\\n- Providers with the right licences will be in a stronger position to launch stablecoin products and offer those to other FIs.\\n- By the end of 2024 we’ll see some marquee partnerships where traditional fintechs are launching a full stablecoin solution, wallets pay-ins and payouts.\\nFor those thinking about adding stablecoins to their tech stack, I hope this collection of views, along with summaries of use cases, can provide some useful perspectives.\\nhttps://lnkd.in/dh7ZAfg2\\nBVNK Guides: Strategies for stablecoins [Report]\\nbvnk.com\\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\\nCEO at BVNK\\nExtending an invite to those in my network, to join me at Currency LDN on 22 May.\\nPayments infrastructure is evolving fast – and there are plenty of fintech innovators out there experimenting with blockchain technology.

This year, we’re joined by Worldpay, FIS and Chainalysis (more to be announced). It’ll be an afternoon short, sharp sessions showcasing new projects, and discussing what’s coming in global money movement – with\\xa0lots of opportunity to network. I hope to see some of you there.\\nLink in comments below!\\n12,445 followers\\nCalling all payments leaders 📢 Join BVNK, Chainalysis, FIS, Worldpay and more on 22 May as we talk fintech innovation and how the industry is bridging banks and blockchains.\\nThe second edition of Currency LDN is a half-day in-person event. Our expert sessions include:\\n- New data on the impact of stablecoins on payment systems, businesses and economies.\\n- Worldpay and FIS on upgrading payments infrastructure with stablecoins and CBDCs – opportunities, use cases, and barriers.\\n- Case study on how Deel is using stablecoins to enable near-instant payments for a global workforce.\\n- Chainalysis on the journey of a crypto payment through the eyes of a financial crime compliance officer and key principles to build a robust compliance programme.\\nFollow the link in the comments to register for free.\\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\\nCEO at BVNK\\nThe next generation of fintechs will build with stablecoins. I believe stablecoins can act as a new base layer for payments. They solve many problems of speed, transparency and accessibility we’re all familiar with in payments:\\n1. If you struggle to access US dollars, stablecoins offer an accessible alternative.\\n2. If you struggle to move money quickly, stablecoins are 24/7 and settle in minutes.\\n3. If you struggle to get visibility into your payments, blockchains give us an immutable, transparent, shared ledger.\\n4. If you’re a fintech selling onward services, the technology is permissionless and composable, giving us new opportunities to innovate.\\nBut network effects for stablecoins are not yet in play. Fiat currencies and systems still power global commerce today. So there is value to be delivered by bridging banks and blockchains. I’ve written more about this and about how BVNK is playing a role, in this blog post:\\xa0https://lnkd.in/d_uABc_g\\nFor this technology to scale in payments, we need infrastructure providers to step in and we need fintech partnerships.

Here are a few things they told us:\\n- Market timing is a challenge we need regulators, banks and governments to come on board. But with stablecoins we’ll find the next category-defining business.\\n- Traditional financial institutions (FIs) are experimenting. When they see clear ROI, they’ll start rolling out stablecoin rails to other countries – this will be a pivotal moment for market readiness.\\n- Stablecoins will reach a market cap of $250bn by the end of 2024, growing 2-3x the pace of the crypto market overall.\\n- Providers with the right licences will be in a stronger position to launch stablecoin products and offer those to other FIs.\\n- By the end of 2024 we’ll see some marquee partnerships where traditional fintechs are launching a full stablecoin solution, wallets pay-ins and payouts.\\nFor those thinking about adding stablecoins to their tech stack, I hope this collection of views, along with summaries of use cases, can provide some useful perspectives.\\nhttps://lnkd.in/dh7ZAfg2\\nBVNK Guides: Strategies for stablecoins [Report]\\nbvnk.com\\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\\nCEO at BVNK\\nExtending an invite to those in my network, to join me at Currency LDN on 22 May.\\nPayments infrastructure is evolving fast – and there are plenty of fintech innovators out there experimenting with blockchain technology.

I believe stablecoins can act as a new base layer for payments. They solve many problems of speed, transparency and accessibility we’re all familiar with in payments:\\n1. If you struggle to access US dollars, stablecoins offer an accessible alternative.\\n2. If you struggle to move money quickly, stablecoins are 24/7 and settle in minutes.\\n3. If you struggle to get visibility into your payments, blockchains give us an immutable, transparent, shared ledger.\\n4. If you’re a fintech selling onward services, the technology is permissionless and composable, giving us new opportunities to innovate.\\nBut network effects for stablecoins are not yet in play. Fiat currencies and systems still power global commerce today. So there is value to be delivered by bridging banks and blockchains. I’ve written more about this and about how BVNK is playing a role, in this blog post:\\xa0https://lnkd.in/d_uABc_g\\nFor this technology to scale in payments, we need infrastructure providers to step in and we need fintech partnerships.
